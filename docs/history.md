# History
I used to use
[markdown_helper](https://github.com/BurdetteLamar/markdown_helper), a ruby gem to generate TOC
for my markdown files but at times I don't have ruby installed in the systems I'm working on. 
It also has a bug, for example, say if inside a code block has a commennt with #, it interprets 
it as header and adds in TOC. Also, project does not seem to be active.
