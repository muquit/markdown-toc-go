Added glossary expansion support with `@KEY@` syntax for consistent documentation. Define reusable content like company names, URLs, and version numbers in a glossary file and reference them throughout your markdown. Supports nested references and rich markdown content in values.

Please look at [ChangeLog](ChangeLog.md) for details on what has changed in the current version. 

The binaries are cross-compiled with https://github.com/muquit/go-xbuild-go. Do not forget to check checksums of the archives before using.

Thanks.
