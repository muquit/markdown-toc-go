# Introduction
`markdown-toc-go` is a simple multi-platform program to generate table of 
contents for markdown files and expand glossary placeholders for 
consistent documentation.  I use it to generate TOC for `README.md` for my 
projects in github.  I know github shows TOC of README.md but you 
have to click on the list icon to show. I want to see TOC at the top of my 
README.

It's also a lot of typing to add link and image tags while creating README.
md files. The glossary feature can cut down a lot of repetitive and 
painful typing by allowing you to define reusable content once and 
reference it throughout your documentation.  A single global glossary file 
can be shared across multiple projects for consistent branding, URLs, and 
common references.

@ASCIIDOC@ has similar feature but it comes with the whole toolchain baggage -
I do use @ASCIIDOC@ documents.  `markdown-toc-go` is just one 
static binary and you're done.

Hope you find this program useful.
