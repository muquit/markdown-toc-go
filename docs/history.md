# History
I used to use
@MARKDOWN_HELPER@, a ruby gem to generate TOC
for my markdown files but at times I don't have ruby installed in the systems I'm working on. 
It also has a bug, for example, say if inside a code block has a comment with #, it interprets 
it as header and adds in TOC. Also, project does not seem to be active. I like
the file inclusion feature of @MARKDOWN_HELPER@, `markdown-doc-go` v1.0.4 adds
this feature.
